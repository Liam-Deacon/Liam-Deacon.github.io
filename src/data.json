The original code base consists of a number of legacy programs developed by different authors spanning a period of almost 20 years and I have therefore spent considerable effort unifying and modernising the source code to better adhere to best practices and standards, whilst also leveraging open source libraries, such as GSL, libtiff, Cairo, and BLAS/Lapack. As part of turning the original programs into a fully-fledged open source project, I have placed the code under Git revision control, produced documentation using Doxygen, created cross-platform builds using the CMake makefile generator/packaging tool, as well as gained experience debugging with GDB. There is an aim of producing a user-friendly GUI/UX using Python/Qt.",

During the development of the package, I have been documenting the code and API using Sphinx to help facilitate future development. Furthermore, as the project has matured I have supported users, adding requested features, addressing bugs and updating the supporting documentation. I also introduced some DevOps practices into this project to target multiple platforms and operating systems.",
